             This system suspends execution of this method at the following `await` statement until the task is complete.
             This allows additional actor functions to execute before we resume execution of this function.
             
             However, because the `mapDataResults` dictionary already contains a value for this item ID,
             any additional functions won't attempt to modify the dictionary. For that reason,
             the dictionary still contains the `.loading` case after resuming, and it's safe to replace
             it with the result of loading (either a value or an error).
